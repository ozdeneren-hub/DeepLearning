# Deep Learning Models for Regression and Classification

This Jupyter notebook contains examples for solving regression and classification problems using deep learning.

## Contents

* **Regression Model:**
    * A regression model is built using the Diabetes dataset.
    * Data preprocessing steps (data loading, train/test split, scaling) are applied.
    * A deep learning model (multilayer neural network) is created with Keras.
    * Model performance is evaluated using MSE and MAPE metrics.
    * Overfitting problem and solutions (early stopping) are demonstrated.
* **Binary Classification Model:**
    * A binary classification model is built using the Breast Cancer dataset.
    * Data preprocessing steps are applied.
    * Model performance is evaluated using the accuracy metric.
* **Multi-class Classification Model:**
    * A multi-class classification model is built using the Iris dataset.
    * Data preprocessing steps are applied.
    * Model performance is evaluated using the accuracy metric.
    * Softmax activation function and sparse categorical crossentropy loss function are used.
* **Overfitting and Early Stopping:**
    * The overfitting problem is explained and solutions are demonstrated.
    * Early stopping method is used to prevent overfitting.
    * Training and validation losses are visualized.
